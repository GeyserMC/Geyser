<!--- DELETING THIS TEMPLATE WILL GET YOUR ISSUE CLOSED! --->

<!--- Please follow this format COMPLETELY and make sure the bug you are reporting has not been reported yet. Reports should contain as much information or context as possible to help us find the problem. Simply creating an issue on a vague topic will not help us at all, and if you are unsure if something should belong here, please contact us on [Discord](http://discord.geysermc.org).-->

<!--- Issues pertaining to connection problems, or anything of that covered on the [Common Issues](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Common-Issues) do not belong here and only clutter this issue tracker. -->

**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**

A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots / Videos**

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Server Version and Plugins**

If you just run Geyser-Spigot, you can leave this area blank as the next section covers this information.

If you're running a multi-server instance, or using Geyser Standalone:

- Give us the exact output from `/version` on all servers involved. Saying "latest" does not help us at all.
- Please list all plugins on all servers involved.

If this bug occurs on a server you do not control, please fill this in to the best of your knowledge.

**Geyser Dump**

If Geyser starts correctly, please also include the link to a dump by using `/geyser dump`. If you use the Standalone GUI, the option can be found under `Commands` => `Dump`. This provides us information about your server that we can use to debug your issue.

**Minecraft: Bedrock Edition Version**

The version of your Minecraft: Bedrock Edition client you tested with, along with your device type (e.g. Windows 10, Switch...).

**Additional Context**

Add any other context about the problem here.
