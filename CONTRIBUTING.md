Thank for for considering a contribution! Generally, Geyser welcomes PRs from everyone. There are some guidelines about what features should go where:


*Pull requests that may not get accepted:* Niche features that apply to a specific group, for example integration with a specific plugin. For now, please create a separate plugin if possible. 

*Pull requests for Floodgate:* Anything that opens up information within the game for developers to use.

*Pull requests for Geyser:* Anything that fixes compatibility between Java or Bedrock, or improves the quality of play for Bedrock players. The exception is wherever direct server access is required; in this case it may be better for Floodgate.


We have some general style guides that should be applied throughout the code:

```java

private static final AIR_ITEM = 0; // Static item names should be capitalized

public Int2IntMap items = new Int2IntOpenHashMap(); // Use the interface as the class type but initialize with the implementation.

public int nameWithMultipleWords = 0;

/**
* Javadoc comment to explain what a function does.
*/
public void applyStuff() {
	if (condition) {
		// Do stuff.
	} else if (anotherCondition) {
		// Do something else.
	}
	
	switch (value) {
		case 0:
			break;
		case 1:
			break:
	}
}
```

Make sure to comment your code where possible.

The nature of our software requires a lot of arrays and maps to be stored - where possible, use Fastutil's specialized maps. For example, if you're storing block state translations, use an `Int2IntMap`.

We have a rundown of all the tools you need to develop over on our [wiki](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Developer-Guide). If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to our [Discord](https://discord.geysermc.org)!
