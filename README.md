Geyser is a bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition, closing the gap from those wanting to play true cross-platform.

## What is Geyser?
Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers.
The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible.

### Please note, this project is still a work in progress and should not be used on production. Expect bugs!

## Setting Up
Please note, Geyser is **not** (currently) a plugin. Watch the video below or take a look [here](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki#Setup) for how to set it up.
