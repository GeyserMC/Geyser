Geyser is a bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition, closing the gap from those wanting to play true cross-platform.

Geyser is an open collaboration project by [CubeCraft Games](https://cubecraft.net).

## What is Geyser?
Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers.
The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible. **Please note, this project is still a work in progress and should not be used on production. Expect bugs!**

Special thanks to the DragonProxy project for being a trailblazer in protocol translation and for all the team members who have now joined us here!

### Currently supporting Minecraft Bedrock v1.16.100 - v1.16.201 and Minecraft Java v1.16.4.

## Setting Up

## What's Left to be Added/Fixed
- Lecterns
- Near-perfect movement (to the point where anticheat on large servers is unlikely to ban you)
- Resource pack conversion/CustomModelData
- Some Entity Flags
- The Following Inventories 
  - Enchantment Table (as a proper GUI)
  - Beacon
  - Cartography Table
  - Stonecutter
  - Structure Block
  - Horse Inventory
  - Loom
  - Smithing Table

## What can't be fixed
The following things can't be fixed because of Bedrock limitations. They might be fixable in the future, but not as of now.

- Custom heads in inventories
- Clickable links in chat
- Glowing effect

## Compiling
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. [Install Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
3. Navigate to the Geyser root directory and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`. This downloads all the needed submodules for Geyser and is a crucial step in this process.
4. Run `mvn clean install` and locate to the `target` folder.
