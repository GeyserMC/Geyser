remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server

# Floodgate uses encryption to ensure use from authorised sources.
# This should point to the public key generated by Floodgate (Bungee or CraftBukkit)

# Bedrock clients can freeze when opening up the command prompt for the first time if given a lot of commands.

# The following two options enable "ping passthrough" - the MOTD and/or player count gets retrieved from the Java server.
# Relay the MOTD from the remote server to Bedrock players.
passthrough-motd: false
# Relay the player count and max players from the remote server to Bedrock players.
passthrough-player-counts: false
# Enable LEGACY ping passthrough. There is no need to enable this unless your MOTD or player count does not appear properly.
# This option does nothing on standalone.

# Configures if chunk caching should be enabled or not. This keeps an individual
# record of each block the client loads in. While this feature does allow for a few
# things such as block break animations to show up in creative mode and among others,
# it is HIGHLY recommended you disable this on a production environment as it can eat
# up a lot of RAM. However, when using the Bukkit version of Geyser, support for features
# or implementations this allows is automatically enabled without the additional caching as
# Geyser has direct access to the server itself.

# Allows custom skulls to be displayed.

# Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether -
# enabling this config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID
# to the End ID. The main downside to this is that the sky will resemble that of
# the end sky in the nether, but ultimately it's the only way for this feature to work.
