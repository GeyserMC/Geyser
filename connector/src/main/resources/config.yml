  motd2: "Another GeyserMC forced host."
remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server

  # Authentication type. Can be offline, online, or floodgate (see https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Floodgate).
  auth-type: online

# Floodgate uses encryption to ensure use from authorised sources.
# This should point to the public key generated by Floodgate (Bungee or CraftBukkit)
# You can ignore this when not using Floodgate.

## the Xbox/MCPE username is the key for the Java server auth-info
## this allows automatic configuration/login to the remote Java server

# Configures if chunk caching should be enabled or not. This keeps an individual
# record of each block the client loads in. While this feature does allow for a few
# things such as block break animations to show up in creative mode and among others,
# it is HIGHLY recommended you disable this on a production environment as it can eat
# up a lot of RAM. However, when using the Bukkit version of Geyser, support for features
# or implementations this allows is automatically enabled without the additional caching as
# Geyser has direct access to the server itself.

# bStats is a stat tracker that is entirely anonymous and tracks only basic information
# about Geyser, such as how many people are online, how many servers are using Geyser,
# what OS is being used, etc. You can learn more about bStats here: https://bstats.org/.
