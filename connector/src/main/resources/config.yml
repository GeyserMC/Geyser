  # The port that will listen for connections
  port: 19132
  # Some hosting services change your Java port everytime you start the server and require the same port to be used for Bedrock.
  # This option makes the Bedrock port the same as the Java port every time you start the server.
  # This option is for the plugin version only.

  # The MOTD that will be broadcasted to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. This is irrelevant if "passthrough-motd" is set to true
  # If either of these are empty, the respective string will default to "Geyser"

  # The Server Name that will be sent to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. This is visible in both the pause menu and the settings menu.

  # How much to compress network traffic to the Bedrock client. The higher the number, the more CPU usage used, but
  # the smaller the bandwidth used. Does not have any effect below -1 or above 9. Set to -1 to disable.

  # Whether to enable PROXY protocol or not for clients. You DO NOT WANT this feature unless you run UDP reverse proxy
  # in front of your Geyser instance.
  enable-proxy-protocol: false
  # A list of allowed PROXY protocol speaking proxy IP addresses/subnets. Only effective when "enable-proxy-protocol" is enabled, and
  # should really only be used when you are not able to use a proper firewall (usually true with shared hosting providers etc.).
  # Keeping this list empty means there is no IP address whitelist.
  # Both IP addresses and subnets are supported.

remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # If it is "auto", for standalone version the remote address will be set to 127.0.0.1,
  # for plugin versions, Geyser will attempt to find the best address to connect to.
  address: auto
  # The port of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # For plugin versions, if address has been set to "auto", the port will also follow the server's listening port.

  # This is useful only when:
  # 1) Your server supports PROXY protocol (it probably doesn't)

  # IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS, DON'T TOUCH IT!

# There are three options this can be set to:
# disabled - the default/fallback, which doesn't apply this workaround

# This should only need to be disabled if using a proxy that does not use the "transfer packet" style of server switching.

# Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether -

# ADVANCED OPTIONS - DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

# Geyser updates the Scoreboard after every Scoreboard packet, but when Geyser tries to handle
