bedrock:
  # The IP address that will listen for connections.
  # There is no reason to change this unless you want to limit what IPs can connect to your server.
  address: 0.0.0.0
  # The port that will listen for connections
  port: 19132
  # The MOTD that will be broadcasted to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. Irrelevant if "passthrough-motd" is set to true
  motd1: "GeyserMC"
  motd2: "Another GeyserMC forced host."
remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server
  address: 127.0.0.1
  # The port of the remote (Java Edition) server
  port: 25565
  # Authentication type. Can be offline, online, or floodgate (see https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Floodgate).
  auth-type: online

# Floodgate uses encryption to ensure use from authorised sources.
# This should point to the public key generated by Floodgate (Bungee or CraftBukkit)
# You can ignore this when not using Floodgate.

# Bedrock clients can freeze when opening up the command prompt for the first time if given a lot of commands.
# Disabling this will prevent command suggestions from being sent and solve freezing for Bedrock clients.

# The following two options enable "ping passthrough" - the MOTD and/or player count gets retrieved from the Java server.
# Relay the MOTD from the remote server to Bedrock players.
passthrough-motd: false
# Relay the player count and max players from the remote server to Bedrock players.
passthrough-player-counts: false
# Enable LEGACY ping passthrough. There is no need to enable this unless your MOTD or player count does not appear properly.
# This option does nothing on standalone.
legacy-ping-passthrough: false
# How often to ping the remote server, in seconds. Only relevant for standalone or legacy ping passthrough.
# Increase if you are getting BrokenPipe errors.

# Configures if chunk caching should be enabled or not. This keeps an individual
# record of each block the client loads in. While this feature does allow for a few
# things such as block break animations to show up in creative mode and among others,
# it is HIGHLY recommended you disable this on a production environment as it can eat
# up a lot of RAM. However, when using the Spigot version of Geyser, support for features
# or implementations this allows is automatically enabled without the additional caching as
# Geyser has direct access to the server itself.
cache-chunks: false

# Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether -
# enabling this config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID
# to the End ID. The main downside to this is that the sky will resemble that of
# the end sky in the nether, but ultimately it's the only way for this feature to work.

# bStats is a stat tracker that is entirely anonymous and tracks only basic information
