  # The port that will listen for connections
  port: 19132
  # Some hosting services change your Java port everytime you start the server and require the same port to be used for Bedrock.
  # This option makes the Bedrock port the same as the Java port every time you start the server.
  # This option is for the plugin version only.

  # in front of your Geyser instance.
  enable-proxy-protocol: false
  # A list of allowed PROXY protocol speaking proxy IP addresses/subnets. Only effective when "enable-proxy-protocol" is enabled, and
  # should really only be used when you are not able to use a proper firewall (usually true with shared hosting providers etc.).
  # Keeping this list empty means there is no IP address whitelist.
  # Both IP addresses and subnets are supported.

remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server

  # for plugin versions, Geyser will attempt to find the best address to connect to.
  address: auto
  # The port of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # For plugin versions, if address has been set to "auto", the port will also follow the server's listening port.

  # This is useful only when:
  # 1) Your server supports PROXY protocol (it probably doesn't)

  # IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS, DON'T TOUCH IT!

# Configures if chunk caching should be enabled or not. This keeps an individual
# record of each block the client loads in. This feature does allow for a few things
# such as more accurate movement that causes less problems with anticheat (meaning
# you're less likely to be banned) and allows block break animations to show up in
# creative mode (and other features). Although this increases RAM usage, it likely
# won't have much of an effect for the vast majority of people. However, if you're
# running out of RAM or are in a RAM-sensitive environment, you may want to disable
# this. When using the Spigot version of Geyser, support for features or
# implementations this allows is automatically enabled without the additional caching
# as Geyser has direct access to the server itself.

# Whether to add (at this time, only) the furnace minecart as a separate item in the game, which normally does not exist in Bedrock Edition.
# This should only need to be disabled if using a proxy that does not use the "transfer packet" style of server switching.

# This option requires a restart of Geyser in order to change its setting.
add-non-bedrock-items: true

# Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether -
# enabling this config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID
# to the End ID. The main downside to this is that the sky will resemble that of
# the end sky in the nether, but ultimately it's the only way for this feature to work.

# ADVANCED OPTIONS - DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

# Geyser updates the Scoreboard after every Scoreboard packet, but when Geyser tries to handle

# This option allows you to specify after how many Scoreboard packets per seconds
# the Scoreboard updates will be limited to four updates per second.
