  port: 19132
  # Some hosting services change your Java port everytime you start the server and require the same port to be used for Bedrock.
  # This option makes the Bedrock port the same as the Java port every time you start the server.
  # This option is for the plugin version only.

  # The Server Name that will be sent to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. This is visible in both the pause menu and the settings menu.

remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # If it is "auto", for standalone version the remote address will be set to 127.0.0.1,
  # for plugin versions, Geyser will attempt to find the best address to connect to.
  address: auto
  # The port of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # For plugin versions, if address has been set to "auto", the port will also follow the server's listening port.

# You can ignore this when not using Floodgate.

# The Xbox/Minecraft Bedrock username is the key for the Java server auth-info.

# Bedrock clients can freeze when opening up the command prompt for the first time if given a lot of commands.

# The following three options enable "ping passthrough" - the MOTD, player count and/or protocol name gets retrieved from the Java server.
# Relay the MOTD from the remote server to Bedrock players.
passthrough-motd: false
# Relay the protocol name (e.g. BungeeCord [X.X], Paper 1.X) - only really useful when using a custom protocol name!
# This will also show up on sites like MCSrvStatus. <mcsrvstat.us>

# Relay the player count and max players from the remote server to Bedrock players.
passthrough-player-counts: false
# Enable LEGACY ping passthrough. There is no need to enable this unless your MOTD or player count does not appear properly.
# This option does nothing on standalone.

# Configures if chunk caching should be enabled or not. This keeps an individual
# record of each block the client loads in. While this feature does allow for a few
# things such as block break animations to show up in creative mode and among others,
# it is HIGHLY recommended you disable this on a production environment as it can eat
# up a lot of RAM. However, when using the Spigot version of Geyser, support for features
# or implementations this allows is automatically enabled without the additional caching as
# Geyser has direct access to the server itself.
cache-chunks: false

# Specify how many days images will be cached to disk to save downloading them from the internet.
# A value of 0 is disabled. (Default: 0)
cache-images: 0

# Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether -
# enabling this config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID
# to the End ID. The main downside to this is that the sky will resemble that of
# the end sky in the nether, but ultimately it's the only way for this feature to work.

# Force clients to load all resource packs if there are any.
# If set to false it allows the user to disconnect from the server if they don't
# want to download the resource packs

# bStats is a stat tracker that is entirely anonymous and tracks only basic information

# ADVANCED OPTIONS - DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

# Geyser updates the Scoreboard after every Scoreboard packet, but when Geyser tries to handle
# a lot of scoreboard packets per second can cause serious lag.
# This option allows you to specify after how many Scoreboard packets per seconds
# the Scoreboard updates will be limited to four updates per second.

# Allow connections from ProxyPass and Waterdog.
# See https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/firewall-guide/ for assistance - use UDP instead of TCP.
