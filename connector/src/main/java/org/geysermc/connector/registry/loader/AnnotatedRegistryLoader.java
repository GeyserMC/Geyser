/**
 * A mapped registry loader which takes in a {@link String} and returns a transformed
 * {@link Annotation} as the value. The {@link R} represents the final result as mapped
 * by the {@link A}, the annotation. This function exists in this registry loader for
 * the purpose of annotations not often being used as a map key. The {@link V} generic
 * represents the actual map value of what is expected. The function transformation done
 * is used for transforming the key, however the value is not expected to be transformed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Keep in mind that this annotation transforming does NOT need to be done, and can be
 * replaced with a simple <code>Function.identity()</code> if not desired.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link BlockEntityRegistryLoader} and {@link SoundHandlerRegistryLoader} as a
 * good example of these registry loaders in use.
 *
 * @param <R> the final result as transformed by the function
 * @param <A> the raw annotation itself can be transformed
 * @param <V> the value
