/**
 * Contains useful collections for use in Geyser.
 *
 * Of note are the fixed int maps. Designed for use with block states that are positive and sequential, they do not allow keys to be
 * added that are not greater by one versus the previous key. Because of this, speedy operations of {@link java.util.Map#get(java.lang.Object)}
 * and {@link java.util.Map#containsKey(java.lang.Object)} can be performed by simply checking the bounds of the map
 * size and its "start" integer.
