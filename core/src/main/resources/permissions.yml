# Add any permissions here that all players should have.
# Permissions for builtin Geyser commands do not have to be listed here,
# unless you want to override their default value.

# If an extension/plugin registers their permissions with default values, entries here are typically unnecessary.
# If extensions don't register their permissions, permissions that everyone should (not) have must be added here manually.
# If a permission is both lists, default-denied permissions takes precedence

default-permissions:
  - geyser.command.help # this is unnecessary

default-denied-permissions:
  - geyser.command.stop # also unnecessary
