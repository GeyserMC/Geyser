bedrock:
  # The IP address that will listen for connections.
  # Generally, you should only uncomment and change this if you want to limit what IPs can connect to your server.
  #address: 0.0.0.0
  # The port that will listen for connections
  port: 19132
  # Some hosting services change your Java port everytime you start the server and require the same port to be used for Bedrock.
  # This option makes the Bedrock port the same as the Java port every time you start the server.
  # This option is for the plugin version only.
  clone-remote-port: false
  # The MOTD that will be broadcasted to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. This is irrelevant if "passthrough-motd" is set to true
  # If either of these are empty, the respective string will default to "Geyser"
  motd1: "Geyser"
  motd2: "Another Geyser server."
  # The Server Name that will be sent to Minecraft: Bedrock Edition clients. This is visible in both the pause menu and the settings menu.
  server-name: "Geyser"
  # How much to compress network traffic to the Bedrock client. The higher the number, the more CPU usage used, but
  # the smaller the bandwidth used. Does not have any effect below -1 or above 9. Set to -1 to disable.
  compression-level: 6
  # Whether to enable PROXY protocol or not for clients. You DO NOT WANT this feature unless you run UDP reverse proxy
  # in front of your Geyser instance.
  enable-proxy-protocol: false
  # A list of allowed PROXY protocol speaking proxy IP addresses/subnets. Only effective when "enable-proxy-protocol" is enabled, and
  # should really only be used when you are not able to use a proper firewall (usually true with shared hosting providers etc.).
  # Keeping this list empty means there is no IP address whitelist.
  # Both IP addresses and subnets are supported.
  #proxy-protocol-whitelisted-ips: [ "127.0.0.1", "172.18.0.0/16" ]
remote:
  # The IP address of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # If it is "auto", for standalone version the remote address will be set to 127.0.0.1,
  # for plugin versions, it is recommended to keep this as "auto" so Geyser will automatically configure address, port, and auth-type.
  # Leave as "auto" if floodgate is installed.
  address: auto
  # The port of the remote (Java Edition) server
  # For plugin versions, if address has been set to "auto", the port will also follow the server's listening port.
  port: 25565
  # Authentication type. Can be offline, online, or floodgate (see https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki/Floodgate).
  # For plugin versions, it's recommended to keep the `address` field to "auto" so Floodgate support is automatically configured.
  # If Floodgate is installed and `address:` is set to "auto", then "auth-type: floodgate" will automatically be used.
  auth-type: online
  # Allow for password-based authentication methods through Geyser. Only useful in online mode.
  # If this is false, users must authenticate to Microsoft using a code provided by Geyser on their desktop.
  allow-password-authentication: true
  # Whether to enable PROXY protocol or not while connecting to the server.
  # This is useful only when:
  # 1) Your server supports PROXY protocol (it probably doesn't)
  # 2) You run Velocity or BungeeCord with the option enabled in the proxy's main config.
  # IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS, DON'T TOUCH IT!

  # Forward the hostname that the Bedrock client used to connect over to the Java server
  # This is designed to be used for forced hosts on proxies
  forward-hostname: false

# Floodgate uses encryption to ensure use from authorised sources.
# This should point to the public key generated by Floodgate (BungeeCord, Spigot or Velocity)
# You can ignore this when not using Floodgate.
# If you're using a plugin version of Floodgate on the same server, the key will automatically be picked up from Floodgate.
floodgate-key-file: key.pem

# For online mode authentication type only.
# Stores a list of Bedrock players that should have their Java Edition account saved after login.
# This saves a token that can be reused to authenticate the player later. This does not save emails or passwords,
# but you should still be cautious when adding to this list and giving others access to this Geyser instance's files.
# Removing a name from this list will delete its cached login information on the next Geyser startup.
# The file that tokens will be saved in is in the same folder as this config, named "saved-refresh-tokens.json".

# Relay the MOTD from the remote server to Bedrock players.

passthrough-player-counts: true
# Enable LEGACY ping passthrough. There is no need to enable this unless your MOTD or player count does not appear properly.
# This option does nothing on standalone.
legacy-ping-passthrough: false
# How often to ping the remote server, in seconds. Only relevant for standalone or legacy ping passthrough.
# Increase if you are getting BrokenPipe errors.

# Whether to forward player ping to the server. While enabling this will allow Bedrock players to have more accurate

# If set, when a Bedrock player performs any emote, it will swap the offhand and mainhand items, just like the Java Edition keybind
# There are three options this can be set to:
# disabled - the default/fallback, which doesn't apply this workaround
# no-emotes - emotes will NOT be sent to other Bedrock clients and offhand will be swapped. This effectively disables all emotes from being seen.

# Whether to add any items and blocks which normally does not exist in Bedrock Edition.

# This option requires a restart of Geyser in order to change its setting.
add-non-bedrock-items: true

# Bedrock prevents building and displaying blocks above Y127 in the Nether.
# This config option works around that by changing the Nether dimension ID to the End ID.

# ADVANCED OPTIONS - DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

# Geyser updates the Scoreboard after every Scoreboard packet, but when Geyser tries to handle

# This option allows you to specify after how many Scoreboard packets per seconds
# the Scoreboard updates will be limited to four updates per second.

# Whether to connect directly into the Java server without creating a TCP connection.
# This should only be disabled if a plugin that interfaces with packets or the network does not work correctly with Geyser.
# If enabled on plugin versions, the remote address and port sections are ignored
# If disabled on plugin versions, expect performance decrease and latency increase
use-direct-connection: true

# Whether Geyser should attempt to disable compression for Bedrock players. This should be a benefit as there is no need to compress data
